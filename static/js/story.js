    longstory :`<p>You live in Competition Country, a nation whose states are constantly competing against each other in various events. However, states can only compete against those that are of similar size. That is, against other states that have a similar quantity of people, objects, etc. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that an accurate census is constantly maintained.</p>

<p>You are employed by the Ministry of Existence as an independent Census Referee. Through this role, you are provided with a list of statements created by a supercomputer reporting the happenings in Competition Country. Although the supercomputer can record everything that happens, it cannot determine during the times at which things existed. Your job is to decide at what point objects and people are in existence based on the statements provided, in order to create an up-to-date census for the Competition Country government.</p>

<p>More specifically, the objects and people need to be classified based on whether they are in existence before, during, and after the happening was reported. For example, if “Julie ate a sandwich,” the sandwich did exist before the action, but after the action it does not. If “Karen built a house,” the house did not exist before the action, but after the action it does. Lastly, if “Carl hit the tree,” the tree existed both before and after the action was completed.</p> 

<p>In order to protect privacy, the information  you read has been anonymized. People’s names have been changed randomly (so "Mary" in one report may not be the "Mary" in another), and many of the other words have similarly been replaced with vague words ("St. Louis" might become "the place", and "the sandwich" might become "the object")</p>


<p>Summary:</br>
1) Read the supercomputer\'s reports.</br>
2) Determine at which time anything or anyone existed.</br>
3) Ignore mental changes or changes in location.</p>`,
